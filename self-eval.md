# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

   It was definitely out of my comfort zone working through the OOP assignment and combining everything we've learned, with new things on top. It eventually clicked during the Hobbit problem! (after missing an "end" and spending 15 minutes trying to figure out what I broke)

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

   I haven't been taking as many breaks as I should. I'm someone that tends to ram my head against a wall until it breaks so to speak, and stepping away breaks that chain of thought. I haven't had any issues staying focused. When I'm doing this full time in Mod 1, I will definitely be taking my breaks, for sanity's sake.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

   One simple typo can break everything. I need to reread my code before moving on to the next line.
